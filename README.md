# George Floyd Protests and 2020 Voting Results
This was the final project I submitted as part of the Data and Policy Summer Scholar Program at the University of Chicago in September 2021. In this project, I conduct a multivariate regression analysis in R to explore the relationship between the frequency and presence of George Floyd protests in 2020 with 2020 U.S. Presidential election voting results. I also explore the effect of the George Floyd protests on mobilizing voter registration in Pennsylvania using a difference-in-difference design.
